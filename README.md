# Weather App

## Description

This is a mobile application designed to help you find out what's the weather around the world! 
This projet is part of an assignment given to me. I used React Native , Expo Go and JS to tackle it.
Using the WeatherApi.com Free API I am getting real time information about the weather and displaying it to the user.

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
1. Download the zip file of the code to your local computer.
2. Open the code with VS Code.
3. run 'npm i' in the terminal to install all the projects dependencies.
4. run "npx expo start". This will start the project. (I ran it with an emulator of Android using Android Studio)
5. check out the App!

## Installation

First, clone this repository:

<!-- start:code block -->
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/zivgl66/WeatherApp.git
cd WeatherApp

# Install dependencies

# Make an .env file
API_KEY=f0561c9a3a904d9caa211030222304
PEXEL_API_KEY=0PoyvD1Cg92r55XokLJytozyIbFADiEWPS9Q82HvPT0mEdAugcBBWaM7

# Run the app
npx expo start

## Usage

In the Home screen you can see your current locations weather. 
Type the city you wish to get the weather for in the search tab.
You can sort the search results by alphabetical order or by distance to a city of your choice.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Search Functionality allows you to search the weather by city (Not Country - weather api doesnt have that functionality, can be solved by using a local list of cities and countries).
