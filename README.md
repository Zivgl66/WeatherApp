# Weather App

## Description

This is a mobile application designed to help you find out what's the weather around the world! 
This projet is part of an assignment given to me. I used React Native , Expo Go and JS to tackle it.
Using the WeatherApi.com Free API I am getting real time information about the weather and displaying it to the user.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
1. Download the zip file of the code to your local computer.
2. Open the code with VS Code.
3. run 'npm i' in the terminal to install all the projects dependencies.
4. run "npx expo start". This will start the project. (I ran it with an emulator of Android using Android Studio)
5. check out the App!

## Usage

In the Home screen you can see your current locations weather. 
Type the city you wish to get the weather for in the search tab.
You can sort the search results by alphabetical order or by distance to a city of your choice.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

Search Functionality allows you to search the weather by city (Not Country - weather api doesnt have that functionality, can be solved by using a local list of cities and countries).

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
