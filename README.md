# Weather App

## Description

This is a mobile application designed to help you find out what's the weather around the world! 
This projet is part of an assignment given to me. I used React Native , Expo Go and JS to tackle it.
Using the WeatherApi.com Free API I am getting real time information about the weather and displaying it to the user.
